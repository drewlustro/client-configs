Client Configs
==============

A small collection of config files for 3rd party command-line applications on my machine, sans any sensitive information. This is mostly for backup purposes or examples for working app setups.

## Included Configs
* [Beets](https://github.com/sampsyo/beets) - a media library management system for obsessive-compulsive music geeks.
* [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) - better zsh shell, specifically config for OS X
* VIM - 4 space soft tabs, etc
